Introduction to the Allulose Market
Allulose, a rare sugar found naturally in certain fruits like figs and jackfruits, has been gaining significant attention in recent years due to its unique properties. It offers a similar taste and texture to regular sugar but contains only about 10% of the calories, making it an attractive alternative for health-conscious consumers and those managing diabetes. The global allulose market is driven by increasing consumer demand for low-calorie, natural sweeteners, and its potential health benefits, such as minimal impact on blood sugar levels.
Definition of Allulose
Allulose is a low-calorie sugar that is naturally present in small quantities in various fruits and plants. It is also known as D-allulose or psicose. Allulose has a sweetness similar to sucrose but contains only about 0.2 to 0.4 calories per gram, compared to sucrose, which contains approximately 4 calories per gram. This makes allulose an ideal ingredient for food manufacturers looking to reduce the calorie content of their products without compromising on taste.
