What is Artificial Turf?
Artificial turf is a synthetic surface designed to resemble natural grass. It is made from polymer fibers, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or nylon, and is supported by layers of infill materials like rubber granules, sand, or a mix of both. Artificial turf offers several advantages, including:
1.	Low Maintenance: Requires no watering, mowing, or fertilizing.
2.	Durability: Withstands heavy usage and extreme weather conditions.
3.	Aesthetic Appeal: Provides a lush green look throughout the year.
4.	Cost Savings: Reduces water and maintenance costs over time.
