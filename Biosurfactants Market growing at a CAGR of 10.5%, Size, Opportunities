Definition
Biosurfactants are surface-active substances produced by microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeast, and fungi. Unlike conventional surfactants derived from petrochemicals, biosurfactants are biodegradable, eco-friendly, and often less toxic. They have the unique ability to lower surface tension between liquids or between a liquid and a solid, making them valuable in a variety of applications, including detergents, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and environmental remediation.
As per Intent Market Research, the Biosurfactants Market was valued at USD 1.3 billion in 2023-e and will surpass USD 2.6 billion by 2030; growing at a CAGR of 10.5% during 2024 - 2030.
